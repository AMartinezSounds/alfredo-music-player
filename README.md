## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Play, pause, skip forward & skip backward any track in the media player
- Have a button to access to the library of tracks
- Select any track and play it automatically.
- If the user is listening the last track, when it finishes, it should start automatically the first one

Super interesting project that help me to understand all the basics about React working with hooks. 
I also learnt about the importance of state management libraries like Redux. Because I managed all the state by passing down props from the top component, and when you have so many props, this method becomes a nightmare.  

### Continued development

I would like to refactor the code to use a state management library.
